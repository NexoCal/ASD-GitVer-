## This is for Archiving purposes

This is a collection of all of my collage assignment on the subject of Algorithm and Data Structure.


## Quick Summary

The workspace contains three main folder, where:

- `src`      : the folder where used code are stored
- `lib`      : the folder to maintain dependencies
- `Archived` : the folder where old code are stored

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

inside `Archived` there are multiple other folder regarding different algorithm and data structure such as 
`[Graf]` and `[TugasTree]`.

there is also `SrcArchive` if you want to see all the code used.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
